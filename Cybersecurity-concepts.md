# What is cybersecurity?
-It is the branch of computer science which deals with the protection of user data stored at servers.
-It complies with protection of Data at rest and and data at transit.
-Data at rest refers to data stored on Drives of PC or web servers while data at transit refers to data flowing through servers.
# Need of cybersecurity?
-As discussed above both data at rest and data at transit are valuable assest for both personal person and any firm.
-Data contains Personal details,bank details,card details,health detail,confidential information related to firms and govt sectors,if any breach happens it can ause huge loss to related person or firm in the form of financial or mental loss.
-Group of hackers or any person can use this data for their personal gain.
-Breaching data can cause Financial and reputational loss to related firm.
-It can attract Govt penalties and snaction also.
-To avoid all above points Cybersecurity is needed.
# CIA triad:-
-Confidentility:- Maintaing proper data security to protect it from any breach using encryption,hash function called as confidentility.
-Intigrity:- Maintaining ensuring data and systems are accurate, consistent, and trustworthy, protected from unauthorized changes, corruption, or destruction.
-Avalibilit:- Maintaining avalibility of data at any time for user ensuring security known as avalibility.
# Cybersecurity follows CIA triad to protect user data and ensure hasslefree data transfer through various servers.
# What is Malware and Types of Malware:-
# Malware:- It is malicious software designed by attacker to infect system and gain unauthorized access.
-All malware need user interaction to be excuted.
-Attacker can deliver malware to target machine or user by malicious link,by advertising,by phishing mail or by social enginering methods.
-Once malware file clicked and downloaded by user,attacker can gain full access to the target system.
-There are differnt types of malware and its mitigation,Defence methods avaliable we will discuss further.
Some of the types of malware are 
# Virus: A self hidng code designed to steal users data
# Trojan: Disguises itself as desirable code i.g Emotet
# worm: Spreds through network replicaating itself.
# Ransomeware: Disable victimss access to data untill ransome is paid i.g RYUK
# Spywrae: Collect user activity data without their knowledge i.g Darkhotel
# Adware: Serves unwanted advertisments i.g fireball
# Keyloggers: Monitors users keystrokes i.g olympic vision
# Cryptojackers: Uses victims CPU GPU for cryptomining without knowing them 
# Rootkits: Give victims device control to hackers i.g Zacinlo
# Common mitigation methods to avoid malware are
1 Avoid clicking unknowing mail links
2 Avoid visiting unwanted and unsecured site.
3 Use strong antivirus.
4 Use strong Encryption algorithms.
5 Keep software updated to latest version.
6 Use strong passwords.
7 Use Multifactor authentications.
8 Configure Firewall
9 Use Defence in Depth.
10 Do regular audits.
11 Trust nothing scan everything i.g ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE.
