# What is cybersecurity?
-It is the branch of computer science which deals with the protection of user data stored at servers.
-It complies with protection of Data at rest and and data at transit.
-Data at rest refers to data stored on Drives of PC or web servers while data at transit refers to data flowing through servers.
# Need of cybersecurity?
-As discussed above both data at rest and data at transit are valuable assest for both personal person and any firm.
-Data contains Personal details,bank details,card details,health detail,confidential information related to firms and govt sectors,if any breach happens it can ause huge loss to related person or firm in the form of financial or mental loss.
-Group of hackers or any person can use this data for their personal gain.
-Breaching data can cause Financial and reputational loss to related firm.
-It can attract Govt penalties and snaction also.
-To avoid all above points Cybersecurity is needed.
# CIA triad:-
-Confidentility:- Maintaing proper data security to protect it from any breach using encryption,hash function called as confidentility.
-Intigrity:- Maintaining ensuring data and systems are accurate, consistent, and trustworthy, protected from unauthorized changes, corruption, or destruction.
-Avalibilit:- Maintaining avalibility of data at any time for user ensuring security known as avalibility.
# Cybersecurity follows CIA triad to protect user data and ensure hasslefree data transfer through various servers.
# What is Malware and Types of Malware:-
# Malware:- It is malicious software designed by attacker to infect system and gain unauthorized access.
 -All malware need user interaction to be excuted.
 -Attacker can deliver malware to target machine or user by malicious link,by advertising,by phishing mail or by social enginering methods.
 -Once malware file clicked and downloaded by user,attacker can gain full access to the target system.
 -There are differnt types of malware and its mitigation,Defence methods avaliable we will discuss further.
## Some of the types of malware are 
 -Virus: A self hidng code designed to steal users data
 -Trojan: Disguises itself as desirable code i.g Emotet
 -worm: Spreds through network replicaating itself.
 - Ransomeware: Disable victimss access to data untill ransome is paid i.g RYUK
 - Spywrae: Collect user activity data without their knowledge i.g Darkhotel
 - Adware: Serves unwanted advertisments i.g fireball
 - Keyloggers: Monitors users keystrokes i.g olympic vision
 - Cryptojackers: Uses victims CPU GPU for cryptomining without knowing them 
 - Rootkits: Give victims device control to hackers i.g Zacinlo
 ## Common mitigation methods to avoid malware are
1 Avoid clicking unknowing mail links
2 Avoid visiting unwanted and unsecured site.
3 Use strong antivirus.
4 Use strong Encryption algorithms.
5 Keep software updated to latest version.
6 Use strong passwords.
7 Use Multifactor authentications.
8 Configure Firewall
9 Use Defence in Depth.
10 Do regular audits.
11 Trust nothing scan everything i.g ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE.
# Malware mitigation methods.
1 Proactive preventions: MFA,user training,strong password,network segmention,Endpoint tools.
2 Early detection: Antivirus,Monitoring,Behavioral analysis.
3 Robust incident response plan: Isolate,analyze,wipe.
- # Social Engineering
-Social engineering is psycological action did by attacker on victim to leak confidential info like password,OTP,personal details or to clik on malicious link or to open malicious email and gain unauthorized access to their machines.
# Remedies on social Eng
- The best remedy on social eng is to avoid such kind of fake scammers and avoid visiting unwanted websites and also be aware while visiting any website and think about clicking anywhere.
# Fiirewall
-Firewall is basic tool which act as network filtering between Web server and hosting machine.
-It is rule based tool which works on rule set by default or modified rules.
-It is network security system.
-It contineously scans incoming and outgoing traffics for any malicious activity.
# Use of firewall
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Malicious traffic blocking.
- Data privacy and control.
- Policy Enforcement
- Threat mitigation.
# What is hardning
- Hardning is the process of securing hardware,network,software,firmware by applying rules,access controls,security measures,various tools to avoid unauthorized access,unauthorized modification and unwanted breach.
- # SOC
- Security operation centre act as security incharge for any malicious activity or to prevent any malicious activity happens.
- SOC uses different types of tools like SPLUNK,WIRESHAR,NMAP,to scan,capture the packets and to create alerts regarding to threat detected in the system.
